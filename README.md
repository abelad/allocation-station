# Allocation Station ðŸš‚

A comprehensive asset allocation strategy testing and analysis framework for portfolio management, Monte Carlo simulation, and retirement planning.

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Portfolio Management**: Create and manage multi-asset portfolios with stocks, bonds, ETFs, and more
- **Strategy Testing**: Backtest various allocation strategies against historical market data
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Run thousands of simulations to test portfolio resilience
- **Efficient Frontier Analysis**: Optimize portfolios using Modern Portfolio Theory
- **Withdrawal Strategies**: Test retirement withdrawal strategies including 4% rule, Guyton-Klinger, and more
- **Risk Analysis**: Comprehensive risk metrics including VaR, CVaR, maximum drawdown, and Sharpe ratio
- **Visualization**: Interactive charts and dashboards for portfolio analysis

### Supported Strategies
- Strategic (Buy & Hold) Allocation
- Tactical Asset Allocation
- Risk Parity
- Mean-Variance Optimization
- Target Date Glide Paths
- Constant Mix Rebalancing

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip package manager

### Quick Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/allocation-station.git
cd allocation-station

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install package
pip install -e .
```

### Install with Development Dependencies

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

## Quick Start

```python
from allocation_station import Portfolio, Asset
from allocation_station.portfolio import StrategicAllocation
from allocation_station.simulation import MonteCarloSimulator

# Create a portfolio
portfolio = Portfolio(name="My Retirement Portfolio", initial_value=500000)

# Add assets
portfolio.add_asset(
    Asset(symbol="SPY", name="S&P 500 ETF", asset_class="equity"),
    weight=0.6
)
portfolio.add_asset(
    Asset(symbol="AGG", name="Bond ETF", asset_class="bond"),
    weight=0.4
)

# Define allocation strategy
strategy = StrategicAllocation(
    name="60/40 Portfolio",
    target_allocation={"SPY": 0.6, "AGG": 0.4},
    rebalance_frequency="quarterly"
)

# Run Monte Carlo simulation
simulator = MonteCarloSimulator(
    n_simulations=1000,
    time_horizon=30
)
results = simulator.simulate(portfolio, strategy)

# View results
print(f"Success Rate: {results.success_rate:.1%}")
print(f"Median Final Value: ${results.median_final_value:,.0f}")
```
